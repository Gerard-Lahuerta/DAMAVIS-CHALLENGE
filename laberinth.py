DAMAVIS CHALLENGE PROGRAM PROPORSAL

@Author: Gerard Lahuerta MartÃ­n
@Date: 20/07/2023

The program is separated in classes needed to run the search algorithm, auxiliar fucntions to calculate 
relevant data, functions that translate the input ( list(list(str)) ) into the structure needed to run the
search algorithm and the algorithm, the algorithm and the main program with the global variable labyrinth 
(the input of the program).

For more information about the algorithms and explanations of the decisions done while programming consult
the Readme file.
